<h2>Description</h2>

<p>"I wanted a Sloppy Joe recipe that was quick and easy, a little sweet, but not unbearably sweet," 
says momof2ingeorgia. "This was AWESOME! I make it once every 2 weeks. Quick and easy, especially on 
a day when we have soccer practices!"

"Great balance of flavors and as easy as opening a canned mix," according to WithaC. "I've made it 
exactly as described and also in the Crock-Pot (brown and drain the beef first). This is now a 
family favorite."

"Terrific recipe," raves steve22. "Ended up using ground venison instead of beef. Couldn't tell the 
difference. Will definitely make again. Quick and easy."</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

<li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>

<li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>

<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

<li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
