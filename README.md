# odin-recipes
The current project is part of a knowledge evaluation of The Odin Project which aims to learn beginners how to code.
As part of the evaluation I will have to build a recipe website.
In order to achieve this I will have to know how to write the boilerplate of the website, add images and links to it, delimitate paragraphs and style the text.
Thank you for reading this :)
